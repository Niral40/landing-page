# landing-page
This is the second project for The Odin Project Foundation course.

This is a landing page for the Sojournal, a Substack newsletter I occasionally run on the side. I copied the layout brief provided, but augmented the given design with my own colours and design elements to give myself a harder challenge. 

Image sources are as follows:
